# Rainbow Clock
This is a programme where you can see the date and time on a pretty rainbow gradient screen. You can always change the gradients as you wish (given that you can code, of course).

## Acknowledgements
This programme is inspired by a [Coding Train video](https://youtu.be/MlRlgbrAVOs) by Daniel Shiffman, which was inspired by a [Tom Scott video](https://youtu.be/zp4BMR88260).
So I guess we have to thank both of them.
